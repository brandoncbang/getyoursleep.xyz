# üí§ Get Your Sleep! üí§
I'm of the belief that sleep is one of the most important things that every functioning adult needs to take seriously. 
Not only does sleep deprivation have nasty short-term effects, it also impacts you in the long term as well.

I've collected some advice and resources on how you can take action to improve your sleep quality.

## Tips

### üèÉ Exercise
Exercising regularly is crucial to being healthy, and it results in better sleep. Simply going on a 20-30 minute walk a 
few times a week is really easy and gets results.

Any exercise you do consistently is better than none at all, so don't worry if you're not doing crazy workouts at first!

Once you get moving, you'll not only sleep better, but you'll also have more energy during the day!

### üì± Get rid of blue light
Your body's circadian rhythm is a pattern that determines when you need to be awake or asleep. Our bodies are used to 
seeing blue light only during the day time, so seeing blue light from electronics at night can keep us awake and 
alert when we don't want to be.

Luckily, almost all electronics now have a setting to automatically adjust the blue light levels when it gets dark. On 
iPhone, this setting is called Night Shift, and can easily be turned on from the Control Center.

### üï∂Ô∏è Make your environment dark
Try to get your bedroom as dark as possible. If you need your TV or phone on in order to sleep, turn the backlight 
to its dimmest setting.

Try to find isolated light sources that might also be keeping you up. It's simple, but once I taped over my computer's 
"on" indicator light, I started getting much better sleep!

### ü§´ Make your environment quiet
Set your phone to "do not disturb" or silent mode. If you need your TV or phone to fall asleep, turn the volume down 
to the point that you can just barely hear it.

Use noise-cancelling headphones if you need to. [This pair](https://www.bose.com/p/refurbished/bose-quietcomfort-45-headphones-refurbished/QC45-HEADPHONEARN-FR.html?dwvar_QC45-HEADPHONEARN-FR_color=BLACK&quantity=1)
works really well, and you can get it for a lot cheaper if you buy them refurbished!

If you need some white noise to sleep, I recommend smoothed brown noise. Regular white noise has harsh high 
frequencies (like a running faucet), brown noise is pleasantly low (like a distant waterfall).

The site [mynoise.net](https://mynoise.net) has all kinds of wonderful background noises that can help with sleep.

### ‚òï Watch your caffeine
Caffeine is amazing, but it is not a replacement for sleep!

If you use caffeine to make up for lack of sleep, it can create a vicious cycle. You take caffeine because
you're tired from not sleeping, but you can't sleep because you're wired from caffeine!

For me at least, it works best when I'm well rested.

It takes a long time to be metabolized. You need to be careful of when you take it, or it will affect your sleep.

Stop taking caffeine for at least 8 hours (but more time is better) before you plan on going to sleep. So if you go 
to bed at 10:00pm, stop drinking coffee or energy drinks after 2:00pm.

Avoid caffeine in powdered or pill form, as it is very easy to overdose. And the [symptoms](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-overdose#symptoms)
are really bad.

Also, even decaf coffee has caffeine in it, just not as much as regular coffee.

### üõå Don't oversleep
Sleep is great, but don't overdo it!

Oversleeping can be a sign of some serious issues. Ironically, it can be just as harmful as not sleeping enough!

An average adult only needs 7 hours of sleep minimum every night. 9 hours or more of sleep is too much.

### üóìÔ∏è Keep a routine
Your body works on a schedule, so it's important to make sure you go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day.

You need to make an effort to wind down when it's getting close to bedtime. It's really easy to get distracted and 
realize that bedtime was 4 hours ago. So you need to be conscious about what you're doing and when to stop.

- Consistent sleep schedulev
    - This is a tough one, but key
    - Waking up consistently is more important than going to bed consistently
    - If you don't get enough sleep that night, don't take a nap
    - Just go to bed earlier that night
    - You really have to make an effort to wind down when it's time to go to bed

### üçï Don't eat late
- Don't eat late in the evening

### üí∏ Pay off your "sleep debt"
- You can catch up on sleep, but only for about the last week
    - "Sleep debt"

### ü™• Practice "sleep hygiene"
- Practice "sleep hygiene"
    - Only use your bed for sleep
    - This associates your bed with falling asleep, making it easier when you need it

### ‚è≤Ô∏è Use your sleep cycles

### üßò Keep calm
- Even if you can't sleep, just quietly laying in bed with your eyes closed has benefits
    - Not as good as sleep, but better than nothing!

## See your doctor
If you are not sleeping properly, you are missing out on a lot of quality of life!

See your doctor if your sleep problem is serious. A sleep study might help narrow down exactly what your issue is.
